## Data Sets

* [Measuring Bacterial Growth](http://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/course_data/ecoli_growth.zip) \| A series of fluorescence and phase contrast images of  *E. coli* cells growing on a rich medium substrate.

* [Testing The French Flag Model](http://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/courses/bi1_2017/data/drosophila_data.zip)\| Brightfield images of developing *Drosophila* embryos with different dosages of the Bicoid morphogen. Also download a [`csv` file](http://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/courses/bi1_2017/data/gregor_data.csv) containing more dosages from Thomas Gregor.

* [LacI Titration](http://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/courses/bi1_2017/data/lacI_titration.zip) \| Brightfield and fluorescence images of *E. coli* cells containing different numbers of transcriptional repressor molecules. Also download the [`.csv` file](http://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/course_data/lacZ_titration_data.csv) of fold-change data from Garcia and Phillips 2011.

* [Measuring Cytoskeletal Filament Length Distributions](http://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/course_data/ActinFilaments.zip) \| Fluorescence images of actin filaments prepared *in vitro* during Physiology 2016.

* [Timing Transcription in *Drosophila*](http://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/courses/pboc_data_sets/fly_elongation_version_02.zip) \| This data set from Hernan Garcia's lab contains images from two developing *Drosophila* embryos in which either the 5' or 3' end of the hunchback morphogen mRNA is labeled with MS2.

## Exercises
The code we write in class will be added here as the course progresses.

* **Integrating Cell Division by the Euler Method** \| Here, we get introduced to the MATLAB programming language and learn how to numerically solve the differential growth equation. [**in-class code**]({{ site.baseurl }}/code/EulerMethod.m)

* **Image Processing via Clicks** \| In this script, we cover how to compute the positioning of the Cephalic furrow in developing *Drosophila* using mouse clicks and some algebra.\| [**in-class code**]({{ site.baseurl }}/code/Cephalic_furrow_class.m)


* **Measuring Growth Rate Through Microscopy** \| We've all (probably) measured bacterial growth by recording the OD of growing cultures. In this script, we analyze a time-lapse microscopy data set by measuring the bacterial area as a function of time. \| [**in-class code**]({{ site.baseurl }}/GrowthMovieAnalysis.m) \| [**data set**](http://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/course_data/ecoli_growth.zip)

* **Timing Transcription in *Drosophila* embryos** \| Using some of the image processing skill we learned while processing the growth movie, we measure the rate of transcription of the *hunchback* gene. [**in-class code**]({{ site.baseulr }}/code/single_color_elongation.mlx)


* [**Nonlinear Regression**]({{ site.baseurl }}/code/nonlinear_regression.pdf) \| We performed a nonlinear regression of our LacI titration data to estimate the best fit value for the binding energy of a repressor to the DNA.


## Extra Tutorials
We have written several more in-depth tutorials on programming in the MATLAB programming language and have posted them below. More will be posted as the course progresses.

* [Intro to Matlab and Sizing Up *E. coli*]() \| This tutorial will teach some basics of the MATLAB programming language as well as developing a feeling for the size of *E. coli* cells. [\[data set \]](http://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/courses/pboc_data_sets/sizing_up_ecoli_8bit.zip)

* [Numerical Integration Of Bacterial Growth](https://rpgroup-pboc.github.io/mbl_pboc_2016/src/euler_method_ODEs.html) \| This tutorial covers how to solve differential equations numerically.
