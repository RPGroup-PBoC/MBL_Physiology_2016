## MATLAB Bootcamp - MBL Physiology

As part of the bootcamp for the Physiology course, we will explore the way that
physical and mathematical models can be used to understand biological systems.
The course combines imaging of fly embryos and bacteria with a variety of
microscopy tools with intensive hands-on Matlab mini-projects covering both
image analysis and biophysical simulations.
