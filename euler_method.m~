 % For the course, you will all have access to the latest version of the
 % MATLAB programming software for use in data acquisition and analysis.
 % While we will spend most of the time blazing through syntax and
 % explaining some of the math behind the programming we will be doing,
 % none of this will be totally unique.
 
 % MATLAB is a high-level programming language capable of doing a wide
 % variety of computational tasks. One of those tasks is performing simple
 % arithmetic operations. 
 
 % Addition 
 2 + 2  
 4 + 5
 10 + 12 
 
 % All of these should print out the result. However, this will very
 % rapidly become annoying when we are performing many long computations.
 % To prevent MATLAB from automatically spitting out an answer, we can
 % simply add a semicolon to every evaluation we perform. 
 2 / 8;
 7^4; 
 100 * 5; % All will be silent. 
 
 % Of course, we will never want to just perform a calculation without
 % storing the output. To do so, we want to assign a value to a variable,
 % which we do with the equals sign. 
 a = 1
